# R10-Project
A mobile application built using React-Native to help attendees for an upcoming tech conference in Vancouver. The mobile app composes a schedule section where attendees could look at what program is on at any given time of day and where they could go into individual session to see what is happening, and which speaker will be running the program. The app also has a section if the attendee chooses to fave a session so they could access the program easily, and lastly has an about page to show the attendees what the program will be about.
